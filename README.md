Project Expense Tracker (Java)
Overview
This is a simple Java program for tracking expenses. The application allows users to input their expenses and view a summary of their spending. It now includes improved file-based storage for persistent data.

Features
Expense Logging: Users can add new expenses with details such as date, category, and amount.
Expense Summary: View a summary of total expenses, categorized expenses, and average spending.
Data Persistence: The program uses file-based storage to save and load expense data for future reference.

File-based Storage
The program now saves expense data to a file (expenses.txt) in the project directory.
The file is created if it doesn't exist, and data is loaded from and saved to this file during program execution.

Check if the expenses.txt file is created and contains data after adding expenses.
