# Simple Expense Tracker (Java)

## Overview

This is a basic Java program for tracking personal expenses. The application allows users to input their expenses and view a summary of their spending. The program includes file-based storage for persistent data.

## Features

- **Expense Logging:** Users can add new expenses with details such as date, category, and amount.
- **Expense Summary:** View a summary of total expenses, categorized expenses, and average spending.
- **Data Persistence:** The program uses file-based storage to save and load expense data for future reference.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mafi777/Project-Expense-Tracker-Java.git
   ```

2. **Compile and Run:**
   ```bash
   javac ExpenseTracker.java
   java ExpenseTracker
   ```

3. **Usage:**
   - Use the menu options to add expenses, view summaries, or exit the program.

## File-based Storage

- The program saves expense data to a file (`expenses.txt`) in the project directory.
- The file is created if it doesn't exist, and data is loaded from and saved to this file during program execution.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that the program has write permissions in the project directory.
- Check if the `expenses.txt` file is created and contains data after adding expenses.
- Review file paths and verify Java version compatibility.
- Insert debug statements or use a debugger to identify issues during file operations.
